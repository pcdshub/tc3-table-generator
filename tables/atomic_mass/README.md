Data source
-----------

Per the public domain Python library
[periodictable](https://github.com/pkienzle/periodictable/blob/master/periodictable/mass.py):

Atomic Weights and Isotopic Composition [#Coursey]_.  The atomic weights are
available for elements 1 through 112, 114, & 116 and isotopic compositions or
abundances are given when appropriate. The atomic weights data were published
by Coplen [#Coplen]_ in Atomic Weights of the Elements 1999, (and include
changes reported from the 2001 review in Chem. Int., 23, 179 (2001)) and the
isotopic compositions data were published by Rosman [#Rosman]_ and Taylor
[#Taylor]_ in Isotopic Compositions of the Elements 1997.  The relative atomic
masses of the isotopes data were published by Audi [#Audi]_ and Wapstra
[#Wapstra]_ in the 1995 Update To The Atomic Mass Evaluation.
